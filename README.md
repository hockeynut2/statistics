statistics
==========
The base program is stats_prgrm.rb, which uses the data stored in unemployment_rates.dat and outputs the data with z-scores to the user's file of choice. The program stats_prgrm_with_file_choice.rb allows the user to choose the file that is inputted and the column in which the data is stored, and outputs the data with z-scores to the user's file of choice. Both programs output the average and standard deviation to the console.
